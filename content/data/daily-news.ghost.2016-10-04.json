Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started.

We are living in a world that conditions us to believe that outer attainments can give us what we want. Yet again and again our experiences show us that nothing external can completely fulfill the deep longing within for \"something more.\" Most of the time, however, we find ourselves striving toward that which always seems to lie just beyond our reach. We are caught up in doing rather than being, in action rather than awareness. It is hard for us to picture a state of complete calmness and repose in which thoughts and feelings cease to dance in perpetual motion. Yet it is through such a state of quietude that we can touch a level of joy and understanding impossible to achieve otherwise.\n\nIt is said in the Bible: \"Be still and know that I am God.\" In these few words lies the key to the science of Yoga. This ancient spiritual science offers a direct means of stilling the natural turbulence of thoughts and restlessness of body that prevent us from knowing what we really are.\n\nOrdinarily our awareness and energies are directed outward, to the things of this world, which we perceive through the limited instruments of our five senses.

Seat height is another source of woes—if the seat is too low, it may stress your knee and cause knee cap pain; too high, it can also aggravate your knee.\n\nFor the right fit, position the seat so that when you pedal downward to the lowest point, your leg is almost straight.

In early 18th century France, gravediggers drank crushed garlic in wine believing it would protect them from the plague. During both World War I and II, soldiers were given garlic to prevent gangrene. It was also used as an antiseptic and applied to wounds to prevent infection.\n\nToday garlic is used to help prevent heart disease, including atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries (plaque buildup in the arteries that can block the flow of blood and may lead to heart attack or stroke), high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and to boost the immune system. Eating garlic regularly may also help protect against cancer.\n\nGarlic is rich in antioxidants. In your body, harmful particles called free radicals build up as you age and may contribute to heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. Antioxidants like those found in garlic fight off free radicals, and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage they cause over time.\n\nThe conditions for which garlic is showing the most promise include the following:\n\n###Heart disease\nGarlic is most often mentioned as an herb for heart disease and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). But evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that garlic may help prevent heart disease. It may slow down atherosclerosis and lower blood pressure a little, between 5% and 8%. Most of the studies on high blood pressure use a specific formulation called Kwai. One study that lasted 4 years found that people who took 900 mg daily of standardized garlic powder slowed the development of atherosclerosis. Garlic also seems to act as a blood thinner, which may help prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\nEarlier studies found that garlic lowered high cholesterol. But almost all recent studies that are high quality have found that garlic didn't lower cholesterol.\n\n###Common cold\nEarly evidence suggests garlic may help prevent colds. In one study, people took either garlic supplements or placebo for 12 weeks during cold season, between November and February. Those who took garlic had fewer colds than those who took placebo. And when they did get a cold, the people taking garlic saw their symptoms go away faster than those who took placebo.\n\n###Cancer\nGarlic may strengthen the immune system, helping the body fight diseases such as cancer. In test tubes, garlic seems to kill cancer cells. And population studies, ones that follow groups of people over time, suggest that people who eat more raw or cooked garlic are less likely to get colon and stomach cancers and cancer of the esophagus. In fact, researchers who reviewed 7 studies found a 30% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among people who ate a lot of raw or cooked garlic. Garlic supplements do not seem to have the same effect.\n\n* A large-scale study, called the Iowa Women's Health Study, looked at how much garlic, fruit, and vegetables were in the diets of 41,000 middle-aged women. Results showed that women who regularly ate garlic, fruits, and vegetables had a 35% lower risk of developing colon cancer.\n\n* Garlic may help the immune system function better during times of need such as in cancer. In a study of 50 people with inoperable colorectal, liver, or pancreatic cancer, immune activity improved after they took aged garlic extract for 6 months.\n\n##Other uses\n* In test tubes, garlic killed roundworms, Ascaris lumbricoides, the most common type of intestinal parasite. But it has not been tested in humans, so researchers do not know if it works in people.\n\n* One study found that men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) had fewer urinary symptoms when they took garlic, compared to men who took placebo. The garlic also reduced prostate size. More research is needed to see if garlic really helps men with enlarged prostate.\n\n* Several studies report that a garlic gel applied to the skin may treat ringworm, jock itch, and athlete's foot.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n\n<p>Garlic has been used as both food and medicine for thousands of years, dating back to when the Egyptian pyramids were built.

We’ve all felt the guilt of accidental duplicate printing, but with the Pencil Printer you can run the extra pages through the eraser end of the printer and come out with a blank slate, ready to be reused.  </p>","amp":null,"image":"/content/images/2015/09/earphones.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2015-09-09 16:01:56","created_by":2,"updated_at":"2015-09-09 16:10:35","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-09-09 16:10:35","published_by":2},{"id":23,"uuid":"3a8e8004-4155-4b61-a417-fccf9bfc37f0","title":"Contact","slug":"contact","markdown":"<featured><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d29422.421992375337!2d88.59482243043139!3d22.809771732261066!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x39f8bb2c20bdf3a5%3A0xcd44aedf53e4de03!2sGuma+Rajibpur+Rd%2C+Bara+Bamonia%2C+West+Bengal%2C+India!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1421694040998\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\"></iframe></featured>\n\n###Address\nNittya Nanda Pally\nP.O.- Dogachia\nPin- 743702\nEmail: [gbjsolution@gmail.com](mailto:gbjsolution@gmail.com)","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><featured><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d29422.421992375337!2d88.59482243043139!3d22.809771732261066!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x39f8bb2c20bdf3a5%3A0xcd44aedf53e4de03!2sGuma+Rajibpur+Rd%2C+Bara+Bamonia%2C+West+Bengal%2C+India!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1421694040998\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\"></iframe></featured></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"address\">Address</h3>\n\n<p>Nittya Nanda Pally <br />\nP.O.- Dogachia <br />\nPin- 743702 <br />\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:gbjsolution@gmail.com\">gbjsolution@gmail.com</a></p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2015-09-10 05:35:41","created_by":2,"updated_at":"2015-09-10 07:02:42","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-09-10 05:35:41","published_by":2},{"id":24,"uuid":"317402c9-b727-4358-b4df-439870dfd002","title":"About","slug":"about","markdown":"**Daily News** is a unique magazine style theme for [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) blogging platform. it is designed focusing content in mind.

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider.
